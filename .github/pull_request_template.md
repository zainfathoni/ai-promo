## Promo Submission Checklist

- [ ] I added the promo to `src/data/promos.ts` with a unique `id`.
- [ ] The promo includes title, description, category, URL, and expiry date.
- [ ] The expiry date uses ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DD`).
- [ ] I verified the link is public and the promo is still active (or clearly marked expired).
- [ ] I ran `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.

## Summary
